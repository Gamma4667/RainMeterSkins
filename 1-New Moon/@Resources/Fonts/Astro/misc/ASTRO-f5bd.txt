Astrology Typeface by "Laser Printing Solutions"          Date: 10/22/03

The enclosed ASTRO font has been specifically designed for use with
Astrology programs. It is the same original Astro font produced by
Kenneth Hirst, but with two additional glyphs--chiron and lilith (Dark Moon). 
This font can also be used within published documents, graphics programs, 
etc. Launch Windows Write and print out ASTRO.WRI for symbol explanation.

This lastest compilation (10/20/03) provides extra tables and dropout
prevention to display more clearly on low resolution screens.

If you are NOT using a font utility to select "font groups," then to
install the TrueType font, simply launch Windows, open the Control
Panel, select Fonts, then File | Install New Font, and choose
Astro from the correct directory.

Once installed, print out the ASTRO.rtf file for symbol location/name.

Note: If you have already installed an Astro font into your system, I
recommend that you remove it. Back up the old font file if necessary 
and delete it from the system using the Control Panel. Otherwise, you
may experience some difficulty (see printing.txt for troubleshooting).

If when using a program like Microsoft Word, you are unable to display
certain symbols like the "opposition" and "sextile", this means that 
AutoFormatting is changing the underlying value for the symbol. Simply
enter Ctrl+Z or use the Undo AutoFormat function. You can also open the
file (attached) called ASTRO.rtf and select any of the displayed symbols,
press Ctrl+C (to copy) and Ctrl+V to paste into your document.

You can also use the in-built Charmap.exe, click the Start button, Run,
enter Charmap.exe and click OK Select Astro as the font. Select the
opposition symbol (second from top left). Press the Select button,
then the Copy button. In Word, simply use paste to insert the opposition
symbol. Now you can  select it and change size, etc.

Note that you will not be able to embed the Astro font into a document.
Legally, you will need to purchase the font, or it's extended version to
do this.  Also note that if the font is used commercially, a license is
required.

If you obtained the font Astro-SemiBold from the net, and looks
similar to this font, it is an improper conversion of my font and is
likely to cause printing problems and system crashes due to the nature of
its poor conversion. If you know of such a font being distributed on the 
net, please advise me.

Although submitted as shareware, this font is *not* to be financially 
distributed (or placed on any disk, or BBS for which a charge is made) 
*without* permission of the author. It is yours to use and enjoy for 30 
days, but at the end of that time, if you are still using this font you 
are morally obligated to send in the shareware fee which is $.6.00 If you 
require the extended ASTRO font that includes Asteroids and zodiacal 
pictographs, send $12.50.

By registering, I can inform you of updates and new releases. Many less
expensive fonts are simply scanned images that have not been optimally
hand tuned, so please do not commercially exploit this font.
