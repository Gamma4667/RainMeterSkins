Display real-time moon phase information on your desktop! 

This Rainmeter skin may be more accurately referred to as *"The Current Moon Phase"*. 

This project allows users to stay informed about the moon's current phase in a convenient and aesthetically pleasing manner.
It displays a realistic image of the moon phase, with textual information on the moon's percentage to full, and its phase type.

It extracts relevant data from [Phase Moon.com](https://phasesmoon.com/), being:
- The current moon percentage - accurate to 2 decimal places, and 
- The current moon type in 8 stages - Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, etc. 

To maintain low resource demands, and given the slow change, the skin updates once every hour, with the percentage updating more regularly - every 3 minutes. 
Relatively high-resolution photography (720x720px) has been sourced from NASA, before being manually edited for transparency - making it accurate to within ~3.5 hours of the day while conserving disk space (i.e. 200 images / 29.5 days). 

To function, the skin simplifies the moon types into two categories - Waxing (becoming full) and Waning (becoming a new moon) - calculating the appropriate folder with this information, then calculating the appropriate image file number based on the current percentage of full moon.
