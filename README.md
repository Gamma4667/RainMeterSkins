Custom RainMeter Skins

1 - New Moon
This Rainmeter skin, more accurately referred to as "The Current Moon Phase," displays real-time moon phase information on your desktop. It extracts data from timeanddate.com, including the current moon percentage and moon type (Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, etc.), and updates every hour. The skin simplifies the moon types into two categories - Waxing and Waning - and calculates the appropriate image file number based on the moon percentage. It then displays the moon phase image, percentage, and type using visually appealing text and images. This project allows users to stay informed about the moon's current phase in a convenient and aesthetically pleasing manner.
